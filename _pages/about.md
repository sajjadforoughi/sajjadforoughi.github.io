> __Update:__ I will be starting as an assistant professor at Imperial College London in January 2024, with a co-appointment from [Earth Science Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/) and [I-X (Imperial + AI)](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/). My group focuses on AI for Energy Transition, with special emphasis on subsurface energy storage and CO$_2$ geological storage. Please reach out if you are interested in [Ph.D. opportunity](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/grantham-institute/public/dtp/2024-projects/grantham-institute-2024-projects/2024_27_ESE_GW.pdf) in Fall 2024!

I am currently a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher working with Professor **[Martin J. Blunt](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.blunt)** and Dr. **[Branko Bijeljic](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.bijeljic)**  in the Earth Science and Engineering Department at Imperial College London. My research interest lies in computational methods for earth sciences.

With over five years of dedicated research experience, I specialize in modeling and simulating multi-phase flow in porous media, covering both pore and continuum scales. My primary focus lies in unraveling the complexities associated with multi-phase flow within porous media, which is paramount for CO<sub>2</sub> and hydrogen storage, as well as flow in manufactured porous structures through digital twin modelling. This deep understanding is crucial for interpreting underground reservoir behaviors, informing process design, and fostering the development of next-generation batteries. Moreover, it is instrumental in leveraging geothermal energy, responsibly managing groundwater resources, and conserving natural construction materials. My research is committed to probing pore-scale phenomena, a commitment that is vital to propelling advancements in major energy transition initiatives.

Apart from my research, I am in charge of the **[pore-scale modelling webpage](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/pore-scale-modelling/)** and also the **[porescale GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/porescale)**, which include all repositories developed in our group.
