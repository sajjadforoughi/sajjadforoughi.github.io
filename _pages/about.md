> __Update:__ I will be starting as an assistant professor at Imperial College London in January 2024, with a co-appointment from [Earth Science Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/) and [I-X (Imperial + AI)](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/). My group focuses on AI for Energy Transition, with special emphasis on subsurface energy storage and CO$_2$ geological storage. Please reach out if you are interested in [Ph.D. opportunity](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/grantham-institute/public/dtp/2024-projects/grantham-institute-2024-projects/2024_27_ESE_GW.pdf) in Fall 2024!

I am currently a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher working with Professor **[Martin J. Blunt](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.blunt)** and Dr. **[Branko Bijeljic](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.bijeljic)**  in the Earth Science and Engineering Department at Imperial College London. My research interest lies in computational methods for earth sciences.

With over five years of dedicated research experience, I specialize in modeling and simulating multiphase flow in porous media at both pore and continuum scales. My primary focus is on understanding the challenges associated with multiphase flow in porous media. This is a critical aspect of CO<sub>2</sub> and hydrogen storage, understanding underground reservoirs, utilizing geothermal energy, responsibly managing groundwater resources, preserving natural construction materials, as well as contributing to process design and the development of next-generation batteries. My research emphasizes the importance of studying pore-scale phenomena to drive advancements in large-scale energy transition projects.

Apart from my research, I am in charge of the **[pore-scale modelling webpage](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/pore-scale-modelling/)** and also the **[porescale GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/porescale)**, which include all repositories developed in our group.
